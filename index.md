## Slow-down COVID-19

### Goal
Detect potential signs of COVID-19 for epidemiological control of populations using chest X-ray (CXR) as a screening tools

### Background
The definitive test for SARS-CoV-2 is the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. However, radiographic findings have been reported as a potential tool for screening. The typical radiographic findinds that have been reported are:
-ground-glass opacities (GGO) in all hospitalized patients
-crazy paving appearance (GGOs and inter-/intra-lobular septal thickening)
-air space consolidation
-bronchovascular thickening in the lesion
-traction bronchiectasis

### Approach
We are developing a free stand-alone client-based web tool for early detection of mild pneumonia from CXR images to help prevent the epidemic. 

### Support or Contact
This tool has been developed by the team of researchers at the [Applied Chest Imaging Laboratory](acil.med.harvard.edu). 
Code and models are open-source.
